1.Website:
         A website is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one 
         web server.


2.Webpage: 
         A webpage is a single document, typically written in HTML, that is accessible through a web browser and displayed on a user's
         device when they visit a specific URL. 


3.Web browser:
            A web browser is a software application used to access and view websites and web pages on the internet.


4.Web server:
           A web server is a computer program or hardware device that stores and delivers web content to clients over the internet 
           or an intranet.


5.HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): 
            HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on webpages. It consists of a series of 
            elements or tags that define the structure, layout, and formatting of web documents. HTML elements can include
            headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and other elements. 


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 
           CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and appearance of HTML documents. CSS allows web developers
           to define styles such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and other visual aspects of web content


2)In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?

    1) Inline CSS: You can include CSS directly within HTML elements using the style attribute.
        For example:

           <div style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a red text with font size 20px</div> 


    2)Internal CSS: You can embed CSS within the <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. This applies styles to the 
     entire document.
          For example: 

                    <head>
   	               <style>
        	            body {
           	              background-color: lightblue;}
       		            h1 {
           	             color: navy;}     
   	               </style>
	            </head>

    3) External CSS: You can create a separate CSS file with .css extension and link it to your HTML document using the <link> tag. This 
       allows for better organization and reusability of styles across multiple pages.
            For example:

                @import url("styles.css");
